# Hands-Free Video Playback Controller 🎥🖐️🗣️

## 🌟 Overview
Control your video playback without touching your keyboard or mouse! This project uses your webcam and microphone to detect simple hand gestures or spoken commands and automates playback controls like play/pause, volume, skipping, and more.

Perfect for those moments when you're cooking, cleaning, eating, or elbow-deep in a project and just want to keep watching your lecture without dirtying up your keys.

## 🙋‍♀️ Why I Made This
As a student at McGill, I often watch lecture recordings on MyCourses (Brightspace), especially while multitasking, like cooking dinner, eating, cleaning, or taking notes. But whenever I wanted to pause or skip back in the lecture, I’d find myself scrambling with messy hands or running across the room to reach the keyboard.
So I decided to build a hands-free controller that lets me (and other students) use simple gestures or voice commands to control playback, without ever needing to touch a laptop. My hope is that this tool will make multitasking a little more effortless, and a lot more hygienic :)
